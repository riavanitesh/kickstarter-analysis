Louise campaign goal, for Great Britian - Musical, is around £4,000. This is outside of the range of outliers for amount pledged, so Louise should probably try to get her play produced for less than £4,000. Half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged.
Louise could focus on Theater and Music concert as these are 2 categories which has maximum sucessfull campaigns. Refer below graph
